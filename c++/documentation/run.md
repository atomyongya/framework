# Run an app
The command `g++ file.cpp -o run` is used to compile a C++ source file (`file.cpp`) and generate an executable file named `run`.

- **`g++`**: This is the GNU C++ compiler. It is used to compile C++ source code into an executable file.

- **`file.cpp`**: This is the C++ source file you want to compile. It contains your code written in C++.

- **`-o run`**: The `-o` option specifies the output file's name. In this case, the executable file will be named `run`. If this option is not provided, the default output filename would be `a.out` (on most Unix-like systems).

So, when you run this command, `g++` compiles `file.cpp` and produces an executable called `run`. You can then run your program by typing `./run` in the terminal.
